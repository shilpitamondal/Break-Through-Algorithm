            1.Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way
              that we can perform operations on these data in an effective way.

            2.Data Structures is about rendering data elements in terms of some 
              relationship, for better organization and storage.

            3.In simple language, Data Structures are structures programmed to store 
              ordered data, so that various operations can be performed on it easily.

            4.It represents the knowledge of data to be organized in memory.

            5.It should be designed and implemented in such a way that it reduces 
              the complexity and increases the efficiency.

           <h3> What is an Algorithm ?</h3>
            An algorithm is a finite set of instructions or logic, written in order, 
            to accomplish a certain predefined task. Algorithm is not the complete code
            or program, it is just the core logic(solution) of a problem, which can be 
            expressed either as an informal high level description as pseudocode or using
            a flowchart.

            <h3>Every Algorithm must satisfy the following properties:</h3>

             1.Input- There should be 0 or more inputs supplied externally to the algorithm.
             2.Output- There should be atleast 1 output obtained.
             3.Definiteness- Every step of the algorithm should be clear and well defined.
             4.Finiteness- The algorithm should have finite number of steps.
             5.Correctness- Every step of the algorithm must generate a correct output.
             
             An algorithm is said to be efficient and fast, if it takes less time
             to execute and consumes less memory space. The performance of an
              algorithm is measured on the basis of following properties :

               (i) Time Complexity
               (ii) Space Complexity
