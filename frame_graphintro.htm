        <h1> Graph Data Structure</h1>
        <pre>
A graph can be defined as group of vertices and edges that are used to connect 
these vertices. A graph can be seen as a cyclic tree, where the vertices (Nodes)
maintain any complex relationship among them instead of having parent child 
relationship.

<h2>Definition</h2>
A graph G can be defined as an ordered set G(V, E) where V(G) represents the set 
of vertices and E(G) represents the set of edges which are used to connect these 
vertices.

A Graph G(V, E) with 5 vertices (A, B, C, D, E) and 
six edges ((A,B), (B,C), (C,E), (E,D), (D,B), (D,A)) 
is shown in the following figure.

<b>Directed Graph:</b> In a directed graph, edges form an ordered pair. Edges 
represent a specific path from some vertex A to another vertex B. Node A is called 
initial node while node B is called terminal node.

<b>Undirected Graph:</b> In an undirected graph, edges are not associated with the 
directions with them.  If an edge exists between vertex A and B then the vertices 
can be traversed from B to A as well as A to B.

<h2>Graph Terminology</h2>
<b>Path:</b> 
A path can be defined as the sequence of nodes that are followed in order to reach 
some terminal node V from the initial node U.

<b>Closed Path:</b>
A path will be called as closed path if the initial node is same as terminal node. 
A path will be closed path if V<sub>0</sub>=V<sub>n</sub>.

<b>Simple Path:</b>
If all the nodes of the graph are distinct with an exception V<sub>0</sub>=V<sub>n</sub>, 
then such path P is called as closed simple path.

<b>Cycle:</b>
A cycle can be defined as the path which has no repeated edges or vertices except 
the first and last vertices.

<b>Connected Graph:</b>
A connected graph is the one in which some path exists between every two vertices 
(u, v) in V. There are no isolated nodes in connected graph.

<b>Complete Graph:</b>
A complete graph is the one in which every node is connected with all other nodes. 
A complete graph contain n(n-1)/2 edges where n is the number of nodes in the graph.

<b>Weighted Graph:</b>
In a weighted graph, each edge is assigned with some data such as length or weight. 
The weight of an edge e can be given as w(e) which must be a positive (+) value 
indicating the cost of traversing the edge.

<b>Digraph:</b>
A digraph is a directed graph in which each edge of the graph is associated with some 
direction and the traversing can be done only in the specified direction.

<b>Loop:</b>
An edge that is associated with the similar end points can be called as Loop.

<b>Adjacent Nodes:</b>
If two nodes u and v are connected via an edge e, then the nodes u and v are called as 
neighbours or adjacent nodes.

<b>Degree of the Node:</b>
A degree of a node is the number of edges that are connected with that node. A node with 
degree 0 is called as isolated node.
