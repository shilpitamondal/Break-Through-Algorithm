        <h1>Circular LinkedList</h1>
        <pre>
            A circular linked list is a variation of a linked list in which the last element is linked to the first element. This forms a circular loop.
            A circular linked list can be either singly linked or doubly linked.
            
            1.for singly linked list, next pointer of last item points to the first item
            2.In the doubly linked list, prev pointer of the first item points to the last item as well.

            <h3>A three-member circular singly linked list can be created as:</h3>
