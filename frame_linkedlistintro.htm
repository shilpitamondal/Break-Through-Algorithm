        <h1>Linked List Introduction</h1>
        <pre>
Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Linked list elements are not 
stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.

Why Linked List? 
Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have the 
following limitations. 
1) The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on the number 
of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper 
limit irrespective of the usage. 
2) Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because the room has 
to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted. 

Advantages over arrays 
1) Dynamic size 
2) Ease of insertion/deletion

Drawbacks: 
1) Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the 
first node.
2) Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list. 
3) Not cache friendly. Since array elements are contiguous locations, there is locality of 
reference which is not there in case of linked lists.

Representation: 
A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node 
is called the head. If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head is NULL. 
Each node in a list consists of at least two parts: 
1) data 
2) Pointer (Or Reference) to the next node 

Following are the various types of linked list:
1.Single Linked List − Item navigation is forward only.
2.Doubly Linked List − Items can be navigated forward and backward.
3.Circular Linked List − Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element 
has a link to the last element as previous.

Following are the basic operations supported by a list:
1.Insertion − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.
2.Deletion − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.
3.Display − Displays the complete list.
4.Search − Searches an element using the given key.
5.Delete − Deletes an element using the given key.
