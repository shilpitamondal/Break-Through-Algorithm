        <h1>Jump Search</h1>
        <pre>
Like Binary Search, Jump Search is a searching algorithm for sorted arrays.
The basic idea is to check fewer elements (than linear search) by jumping 
ahead by fixed steps or skipping some elements in place of searching all elements.

For example, suppose we have an array arr[] of size n and block (to be jumped) size m. 
Then we search at the indexes arr[0], arr[m], arr[2m]…..arr[km] and so on.
Once we find the interval (arr[km] &lt; x &lt; arr[(k+1)m]),
we perform a linear search operation from the index km to find the element x.
 

Let’s consider the following array:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610]. 
Length of the array is 16.
Jump search will find the value of 55 with the following steps assuming that the
block size to be jumped is 4.
STEP 1: Jump from index 0 to index 4;
STEP 2: Jump from index 4 to index 8;
STEP 3: Jump from index 8 to index 12;
STEP 4: Since the element at index 12 is greater than 55 we will jump back a step to 
        come to index 8.
STEP 5: Perform linear search from index 8 to get the element 55.

            {

                        return -1;

                    // If we reached next block or end of 
                    // array, element is not present. 
                    if (prev == min(step, n)) 
                        return -1; 
                } 
                // If element is found 
                if (arr[prev] == x) 
                    return prev; 
              
                return -1;

            // Driver program to test function 
            int main() 
            { 
                int arr[] = { 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 
                            34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610 }; 
                int x = 55; 
                int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]); 
                  
                // Find the index of 'x' using Jump Search 
                int index = jumpSearch(arr, x, n); 
              
                // Print the index where 'x' is located 
                cout &lt;&lt; "\nNumber " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; " is at index "&lt;&lt; index; 
                return 0; 
            } 
             
            <h3>Output:-</h3>

            Number 55 is at index 10

            <h3>complexity:-</h3>
            Time Complexity : O(√n)
            Auxiliary Space : O(1)

           <h3> Works only sorted arrays.</h3>
-The optimal size of a block to be jumped is (√ n). 
This makes the time complexity of Jump Search O(√ n).
-The time complexity of Jump Search is between 
Linear Search ( ( O(n) ) and Binary Search ( O (Log n) ).
Binary Search is better than Jump Search, but Jump search 
has an advantage that we traverse back only once 
(Binary Search may require up to O(Log n) jumps, 
consider a situation where the element to be
searched is the smallest element or smaller than the smallest). 
So in a system where binary search is costly, we use Jump Search.
