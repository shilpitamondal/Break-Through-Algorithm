        <h1>Singly Linked List</h1>
        <pre>
            It is the most common. Each node has data and a pointer to the next node.

            <h3>Node is represented as:</h3>
             struct node {
                int data;
                struct node *next;
            }
        </pre>

A three-member singly linked list can be created as:

/* Initialize nodes */
struct node *head;
struct node *one = NULL;
struct node *two = NULL;
struct node *three = NULL;

/* Allocate memory */
one = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
two = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
three = malloc(sizeof(struct node));

/* Assign data values */
one->data = 1;
two->data = 2;
three->data = 3;

/* Connect nodes */
one->next = two;
two->next = three;
three->next = NULL;

/* Save address of first node in head */
head = one;           
       </pre>
